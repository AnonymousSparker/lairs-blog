        content: `<h2>Summary of this article :</h2><blockquote>Hello everyone this blog covers everything beginner aspirants need to know about JEE Mains and Advanced exams, including exam patterns, syllabus, eligibility, preparation tips, important websites, FAQs, and reliable sources for 2025. It serves as a complete guide for engineering aspirants preparing for these pivotal exams.</blockquote><h2>What is JEE?</h2><p>The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) is a<strong> Nation-wide</strong> entrance exam conducted every year in two round: JEE Main and JEE Advanced. These exams determine admission to India's top ranking engineering institutes like IITs, NITs, and IIITs. It is considered India's one of the <strong>Toughest Entrance</strong> exams among NEET, UPSC etc.</p><h3><s>And what JEE is not?</s></h3><p>JEE is not the edge of the cliff, if you cleared this exam that doesn't mean you are automatically destined to be something catastrophic but yes clearing JEE  certainly means that the student got high potential, but they still need to hone and hustle for thier goals. You will get a high reputed college once you secured a seat in them but you will still have to study. JEE is just the first step towards the future.</p><h2>JEE Mains Overview:</h2><p>JEE Mains serves as the preliminary stage and tests candidates on core physics, chemistry, and mathematics topics primarily from the Class 11 and 12 syllabus. It is a computer-based test with a moderate difficulty level focusing on concept clarity, speed, and accuracy. Clearing JEE Mains is mandatory to qualify for JEE Advanced. The exam usually contains 75 questions covering all three subjects, balancing speed and precision.</p><p>The exam is conducted twice to give candidates two independent chances to improve performance without waiting an entire year. Performance can vary due to stress, gaps in preparation, or unexpected mistakes, so two sessions help reduce randomness and reward consistent understanding. For admission and ranking, the best score out of the two attempts is considered, which encourages students to treat the first attempt as both a serious opportunity and a hands on learning experience.</p><h2>JEE Advanced Overview:</h2><p>JEE Advanced is the subsequent, more challenging stage available to roughly the top 2,50,000 JEE Mains rank holders. This exam demands deeper analytical skills, complex problem-solving, and covers advanced concepts beyond the standard syllabus, including </p><ul><li>Wave Optics</li><li>Rigid Body Dynamics in physics</li><li>Reaction mechanisms in organic chemistry</li><li>Advanced integration techniques in math </li></ul><p>The questions are conceptual, often integrating multiple topics in one.</p><h2>Eligibility &amp; Pattern:</h2><p>Once a student clears JEE Mains with a certain percentile they are eligible for NITs, IIITs and other government institutes. JEE Advanced percentile matters specifically for IIT admissions and is conducted only once a year. Mains allows multiple attempts; Advanced allows two attempts. </p><p><strong>KEEP IN MIND YOU CANNOT APPEAR FOR JEE ADVANCED IF YOU HAVEN'T CLEARED JEE MAINS WITH REQUIRED PERCENTILE</strong></p><h3>JEE Mains Cutoff 2025 :</h3><p><strong><div style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center;"><table style="undefined;table-layout: fixed; width: 422px"><colgroup><col style="width: 232px"><col style="width: 190px"></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>JEE Mains cutoff 2025</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>General</td><td>93.102</td></tr><tr><td>Person with Disability (PWD)</td><td>0.0793</td></tr><tr><td>Economically Weak Section (EWS)</td><td>80.383</td></tr><tr><td>OBC</td><td>79..43</td></tr><tr><td>SC</td><td>61.152</td></tr><tr><td>ST</td><td>47.902</td></tr></tbody></table></div></strong></p><h2>Marking scheme of JEE Mains and JEE Advanced</h2><h3>JEE Mains</h3><p>In <strong>JEE Mains</strong>, the exam has 75 questions in total that are to be answered. Each subject has 25 questions: 20 multiple-choice and 5 numerical. Every correct answer gives 4 marks, every wrong answer in both MCQ and numerical deducts 1 mark, and leaving a question unattempted gives zero. The paper is out of 300 marks overall, with 100 marks per subject. So it is often considered a good approach to skip the questions you have no idea about because guess marking can deduct one mark whereas if you skip you won't get a -1</p><h3>JEE Advanced</h3><p>In <strong>JEE Advanced</strong>, the marking scheme and number of questions changes every year and is intentionally unpredictable. It typically consists of two papers, Paper 1 and Paper 2, both mandatory. In 2025 JEE advanced consisted of 96 questions, 48 question in each paper. Each paper has physics, chemistry, and mathematics sections, but the number of questions, total marks, and marking rules vary. In 2025 each subject had 16 questions in both papers. Advanced uses multiple formats like multiple-choice with one correct, multiple correct options, numerical answers, match-the-following, and integer-based problems. It often includes partial marking for partially correct answers, negative marking for wrong answers, and sometimes zero marking on specific types. The combined score of Paper 1 and Paper 2 determines the final rank. </p><h3>Details of m<strong>arking scheme </strong>JEE advanced 2025</h3><p><strong>Total marks : </strong>360 (<em>180 paper 1 + 180 paper 2)</em></p><p><strong>Marks per subject : </strong>60 </p><ul><li>-(ve) marking varied across the sections but exact marking scheme depended for each question-type</li><li>Partial marking was allocated for some multiple-choice question</li></ul><h3>Section-wise marks distrbution (Each Paper)</h3><p><strong>Section I : </strong>12 marks <em>max</em></p><p><strong>Section II : </strong>12 marks <em>max</em></p><p><strong>Section III : </strong>24 marks <em>max</em></p><p><strong>Section IV : </strong>12 marks <em>max</em></p><p>The variable marking pattern in Advanced makes it challenging because candidate will need deep conceptual understanding and discourages guesswork, focusing on analytical ability rather than speed alone.</p><h2>Preparation Tips for JEE:</h2><ul><li>Understand the syllabus deeply and use NCERT textbooks as the foundation.</li><li>Keep solving PYQs throught the preparation. Focus on Accuracy, Speed more.</li><li>Time management and focused study sessions paired with regukar revisions strengthen concept retention.</li><li>Collaborate in study groups for doubt clearing and alternative problem-solving methods.</li><li>Emphasize understanding concepts over rote learning, especially for Advanced.</li></ul><p class="ql-align-center"><div style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center;"><div class="section-divider"></div></div></p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What is the main difference between JEE Mains and JEE Advanced?</h3><blockquote>JEE Mains tests basic concept clarity and speed; JEE Advanced requires deep understanding and complex problem-solving skills beyond the standard syllabus.</blockquote><h3>How many times can I attempt JEE Mains and Advanced?</h3><blockquote>JEE Mains can be attempted up to four times a year; JEE Advanced is allowed two attempts in consecutive years.</blockquote><h3>Are NCERT books sufficient for JEE preparation?</h3><blockquote>NCERT books are essential, especially for JEE Mains.

        content: `<h3>Delhi's Getting Bomb Threats Again – Here's What's Really Going On</h3><p>So, Delhi woke up to yet another bomb scare today (November 20, 2025), and honestly, it's getting exhausting. Multiple schools across the capital received threatening emails this morning, causing major panic and disruptions. Let's break down what happened and what we know so far.</p><h3>What Happened This Morning?</h3><p>Early Thursday morning, at least three prominent private schools in Delhi received bomb threat emails. We're talking about big names here – The British School in Chanakyapuri, Modern School on Barakhamba Road, and Sanskriti School in Chanakyapuri. The threats came in through emails, and obviously, everyone freaked out (rightfully so).</p><p>The Delhi Police didn't waste time though. Bomb disposal squads, dog squads, and fire department teams rushed to all these schools immediately. Students and staff were evacuated as a precaution while security teams combed through every corner of the buildings.</p><p>The good news? Nothing suspicious was found. The police have declared these threats as hoaxes, but the searches were still thorough because, you know, better safe than sorry.</p><h3>This Isn't the First Time</h3><p>Here's the thing – this is becoming way too common. Just two days ago, on November 18, four district courts (Dwarka, Rohini, Saket, and Patiala House) and two CRPF-run schools (in Dwarka and Prashant Vihar) received similar bomb threats. Those were through both emails and phone calls.</p><p>The threats even mentioned Jaish-e-Mohammed, a terrorist organization, which made things even more serious. But after extensive searches involving bomb squads and security personnel, those also turned out to be hoaxes.</p><h3>Why Is This Happening So Much?</h3><p>The real question everyone's asking is – why are these hoax threats becoming so frequent? Delhi is already on edge after the tragic Red Fort blast on November 10, where 14 people lost their lives. The city's security is on high alert, and these fake threats are not helping anyone.</p><h3>These hoax calls and emails are:</h3><p><strong>1. Wasting crucial resources –</strong> bomb squads, police personnel, and emergency services are being deployed for false alarms</p><p><strong>2. Causing massive disruptions –</strong> schools getting evacuated, court proceedings getting suspended, parents panicking</p><p>3. Creating <strong>unnecessary fear</strong> in an already tense atmosphere</p><p>4. Making it <strong>harder for authorities</strong> to respond to actual emergencies</p><h3>What Are Authorities Doing?</h3><p>The Delhi Police are taking this seriously (as they should). They're:</p><p>- Tracing the sources of these emails and phone calls</p><p>- Investigating whether these threats are coordinated or random</p><p>- Trying to identify the people behind these hoax calls</p><p>- Keeping security heightened across all public institutions</p><p>The problem is, these callers often use VPNs, fake email addresses, and turn off their phones immediately after making threats, making it harder to track them down quickly.</p><h3>The Bottom Line</h3><p>While it's a relief that all these threats have been hoaxes so far, we can't take them lightly. Every threat needs to be investigated properly because we never know when one might be real. But at the same time, whoever is behind these false alarms needs to be caught and held accountable ASAP.</p><p>For students, parents, and people working in these institutions – stay alert but don't panic. Follow the instructions from authorities during evacuations, and trust that the security teams are doing their job.</p><p>Dehli's been through a lot lately, and we don't need people adding to the chaos with fake threats. Let's hope the police track down these culprits soon and put an end to this nonsense.</p><p>Stay safe, everyone. 🙏</p><p><a href="https://staticimg.amarujala.com/assets/images/2025/11/20/thall-thhamaka_48b6fd984f08469a49db35711811eb66.jpeg?w=674&amp;dpr=1.0&amp;q=80" target="_blank">thumbnail.img</a></p>`

        content: `<h2>The Reality Check: Delhi's Air Crisis in Numbers</h2><p>As of November 20, 2025, Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) has crossed the dreaded 400 mark, officially entering the 'severe' category. In some areas like Wazirpur, the AQI has skyrocketed to a staggering 477, while PM2.5 levels have reached 335 µg/m³ — that's more than 5 times the government's safe limit of 60 µg/m³.</p><p>To put this in perspective: breathing Delhi's air right now is equivalent to smoking several cigarettes a day. Every breath you take contains microscopic particles that lodge deep in your lungs, potentially causing long-term damage.</p><h3>Understanding the AQI Scale</h3><p>The Air Quality Index is measured on a scale that helps us understand what we're breathing:</p><p>• 0-50: Good — Fresh air, safe for everyone</p><p>• 51-100: Satisfactory — Acceptable air quality</p><p>• 101-200: Moderate — Sensitive groups may experience issues</p><p>• 201-300: Poor — Everyone may feel discomfort</p><p>• 301-400: Very Poor — Respiratory issues common</p><p>• 401-500: Severe — Health emergency, affects everyone</p><p>Delhi is currently <strong>hovering around 400+</strong>, firmly in the <strong>'severe' zone</strong>. The forecast suggests it will remain in the 'very poor' to 'severe' range for the next six days, with no immediate relief in sight.</p><p>Why Is This Happening?</p><p>Delhi's winter air crisis isn't new, but understanding the causes helps us prepare better:</p><p><strong>1. Stubble Burning</strong>: Farmers in neighboring states burn crop residue, sending thick smoke into Delhi's atmosphere.</p><p><strong>2. Vehicular Emissions</strong>: Millions of vehicles on Delhi's roads contribute significantly to PM2.5 and PM10 pollution.</p><p><strong>3. Industrial Pollution</strong>: Factories and thermal power plants in the NCR region add to the toxic mix.</p><p><strong>4. Construction Dust</strong>: Despite regulations, dust from construction sites remains a major contributor.</p><p><strong>5. Weather Conditions</strong>: Low wind speeds and temperature inversions trap pollutants close to the ground, creating the thick smog blanket we see.</p><p><strong>6. Firecracker Usage</strong>: Post-Diwali effects</p><h3>Safety Measures: How to Protect Yourself</h3><p>While we can't control the air quality, we can take steps to minimize its impact on our health. Here's a list of safety measures you can take:</p><p><strong>✓ 1. Wear N95/N99 Masks</strong></p><p>Not all masks are created equal. Regular surgical or cloth masks won't cut it. Invest in N95 or N99 masks that can filter out PM2.5 particles. Wear them whenever you step outside, especially during peak pollution hours (early morning and evening).</p><p><strong>✓ 2. Limit Outdoor Activities</strong></p><p>This is especially crucial for children, elderly people, and those with existing respiratory or heart conditions. Avoid morning walks, outdoor exercise, and playing outside when AQI is above 300. Check the AQI before planning any outdoor activities.</p><p><strong>✓ 3. Use Air Purifiers Indoors</strong></p><p>Invest in a HEPA air purifier for your home, especially for bedrooms. Keep windows and doors closed during high pollution hours. However, remember that purifiers have limitations — they work best in enclosed spaces.</p><p><strong>✓ 4. Stay Hydrated and Eat Right</strong></p><p>Drink plenty of water to help your body flush out toxins. Include antioxidant-rich foods in your diet — green tea, jaggery, turmeric, and fresh fruits like oranges and pomegranates can help combat the effects of pollution.</p><p><strong>✓ 5. Monitor AQI Daily</strong></p><p>Download AQI monitoring apps or check websites like AQI.in, CPCB's Sameer app, or AccuWeather. Plan your day based on pollution levels. If AQI crosses 400, it's a health emergency — stay indoors as much as possible.</p><p><strong>✓ 6. Create a Clean Room</strong></p><p>Designate one room in your house as a "clean room" with an air purifier running continuously. Use this space for sleeping and studying. Seal any cracks in doors and windows.</p><p><strong>✓ 7. Avoid Smoking and Burning Incense</strong></p><p>Indoor air pollution from cigarettes, agarbatti, or burning anything adds to the problem. Keep your indoor air as clean as</p><p><strong>✓ 8. Use Public Transport or Carpool</strong></p><p>Every vehicle on the road adds to pollution. If you must go out, use metro, buses, or carpool. Better yet, work from home if your employer allows it during high pollution days.</p><p><strong>✓ 9. Consult a Doctor if Symptoms Persist</strong></p><p>If you experience persistent coughing, breathing difficulties, chest pain, or irritation in eyes and throat, don't ignore it. Consult a doctor immediately. People with asthma or other respiratory conditions should keep their medications handy.</p><p><strong>✓ 10. Plant Indoor Plants</strong></p><p>While they won't solve the pollution crisis, plants like spider plants, peace lilies, and snake plants can help improve indoor air quality naturally.</p>`

        content: `<h2><strong>10th Grade: The Peak of My Academic Delusion</strong></h2><p>10th is funny. Everyone treats it like the “endgame,” but honestly, it’s the calm before the actual storm.</p><p>Here’s what 10th felt like for me:</p><h3><strong>1. Is 10th really hard or it's all just hype?</strong></h3><p>Short answer - <strong>Yes </strong>it's just hype. 10th's tough but not the way they exaggerate it. You will learn some base concepts that will be used in 11th but even if you are weak in them it still don't matter much until you score the percentage you need for your stream.</p><p>I am not saying you can get top grades in your school if you are weak but I am not saying this either that if you don't understand how mitochondria works than you are doomed <em>("I don't know even B of biology lol 😭")</em></p><p>Because suppose you are aiming for JEE than you will need physics chemistry and maths as your strong subjects. Strong enough so you can meet the eligibility for science stream as per your education board.</p><p>Keep in mind that you don't need 90+ percentage to be successful in life. Trust me if you are even a 78+ scorer than you are good. But yea if you dream of going to foreign universities like MIT than you may need a good percentage for manuscript records.</p><p>But again only if you want a foreign university and that too maybe adjusted.</p><p>I scored 85% in my boards and I was worried even after pursuing science stream that I may not be able to cope up but trust me 11th starts from a new basic for toppers and alsaxdl.</p><h3><strong>2. Parental pressure to be topper</strong></h3><p>the classic dialogue of Indian parents</p><blockquote>"10th mei 90% se kam aaye to jeevan barbad hai"</blockquote><p>I am sure you would have heard this dialogue. Trust me. 10th marksheet is just a trophy not a life changer, treat them like normal exams.</p><h3><br></h3>`
