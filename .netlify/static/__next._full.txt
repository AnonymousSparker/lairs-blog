7:Tf34,<h3>Delhi's Getting Bomb Threats Again – Here's What's Really Going On</h3><p>So, Delhi woke up to yet another bomb scare today (November 20, 2025), and honestly, it's getting exhausting. Multiple schools across the capital received threatening emails this morning, causing major panic and disruptions. Let's break down what happened and what we know so far.</p><h3>What Happened This Morning?</h3><p>Early Thursday morning, at least three prominent private schools in Delhi received bomb threat emails. We're talking about big names here – The British School in Chanakyapuri, Modern School on Barakhamba Road, and Sanskriti School in Chanakyapuri. The threats came in through emails, and obviously, everyone freaked out (rightfully so).</p><p>The Delhi Police didn't waste time though. Bomb disposal squads, dog squads, and fire department teams rushed to all these schools immediately. Students and staff were evacuated as a precaution while security teams combed through every corner of the buildings.</p><p>The good news? Nothing suspicious was found. The police have declared these threats as hoaxes, but the searches were still thorough because, you know, better safe than sorry.</p><h3>This Isn't the First Time</h3><p>Here's the thing – this is becoming way too common. Just two days ago, on November 18, four district courts (Dwarka, Rohini, Saket, and Patiala House) and two CRPF-run schools (in Dwarka and Prashant Vihar) received similar bomb threats. Those were through both emails and phone calls.</p><p>The threats even mentioned Jaish-e-Mohammed, a terrorist organization, which made things even more serious. But after extensive searches involving bomb squads and security personnel, those also turned out to be hoaxes.</p><h3>Why Is This Happening So Much?</h3><p>The real question everyone's asking is – why are these hoax threats becoming so frequent? Delhi is already on edge after the tragic Red Fort blast on November 10, where 14 people lost their lives. The city's security is on high alert, and these fake threats are not helping anyone.</p><h3>These hoax calls and emails are:</h3><p><strong>1. Wasting crucial resources –</strong> bomb squads, police personnel, and emergency services are being deployed for false alarms</p><p><strong>2. Causing massive disruptions –</strong> schools getting evacuated, court proceedings getting suspended, parents panicking</p><p>3. Creating <strong>unnecessary fear</strong> in an already tense atmosphere</p><p>4. Making it <strong>harder for authorities</strong> to respond to actual emergencies</p><h3>What Are Authorities Doing?</h3><p>The Delhi Police are taking this seriously (as they should). They're:</p><p>- Tracing the sources of these emails and phone calls</p><p>- Investigating whether these threats are coordinated or random</p><p>- Trying to identify the people behind these hoax calls</p><p>- Keeping security heightened across all public institutions</p><p>The problem is, these callers often use VPNs, fake email addresses, and turn off their phones immediately after making threats, making it harder to track them down quickly.</p><h3>The Bottom Line</h3><p>While it's a relief that all these threats have been hoaxes so far, we can't take them lightly. Every threat needs to be investigated properly because we never know when one might be real. But at the same time, whoever is behind these false alarms needs to be caught and held accountable ASAP.</p><p>For students, parents, and people working in these institutions – stay alert but don't panic. Follow the instructions from authorities during evacuations, and trust that the security teams are doing their job.</p><p>Dehli's been through a lot lately, and we don't need people adding to the chaos with fake threats. Let's hope the police track down these culprits soon and put an end to this nonsense.</p><p>Stay safe, everyone. 🙏</p>8:T13e3,<h2>The Reality Check: Delhi's Air Crisis in Numbers</h2><p>As of November 20, 2025, Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) has crossed the dreaded 400 mark, officially entering the 'severe' category. In some areas like Wazirpur, the AQI has skyrocketed to a staggering 477, while PM2.5 levels have reached 335 µg/m³ — that's more than 5 times the government's safe limit of 60 µg/m³.</p><p>To put this in perspective: breathing Delhi's air right now is equivalent to smoking several cigarettes a day. Every breath you take contains microscopic particles that lodge deep in your lungs, potentially causing long-term damage.</p><h3>Understanding the AQI Scale</h3><p>The Air Quality Index is measured on a scale that helps us understand what we're breathing:</p><p>• 0-50: Good — Fresh air, safe for everyone</p><p>• 51-100: Satisfactory — Acceptable air quality</p><p>• 101-200: Moderate — Sensitive groups may experience issues</p><p>• 201-300: Poor — Everyone may feel discomfort</p><p>• 301-400: Very Poor — Respiratory issues common</p><p>• 401-500: Severe — Health emergency, affects everyone</p><p>Delhi is currently <strong>hovering around 400+</strong>, firmly in the <strong>'severe' zone</strong>. The forecast suggests it will remain in the 'very poor' to 'severe' range for the next six days, with no immediate relief in sight.</p><p>Why Is This Happening?</p><p>Delhi's winter air crisis isn't new, but understanding the causes helps us prepare better:</p><p><strong>1. Stubble Burning</strong>: Farmers in neighboring states burn crop residue, sending thick smoke into Delhi's atmosphere.</p><p><strong>2. Vehicular Emissions</strong>: Millions of vehicles on Delhi's roads contribute significantly to PM2.5 and PM10 pollution.</p><p><strong>3. Industrial Pollution</strong>: Factories and thermal power plants in the NCR region add to the toxic mix.</p><p><strong>4. Construction Dust</strong>: Despite regulations, dust from construction sites remains a major contributor.</p><p><strong>5. Weather Conditions</strong>: Low wind speeds and temperature inversions trap pollutants close to the ground, creating the thick smog blanket we see.</p><p><strong>6. Firecracker Usage</strong>: Post-Diwali effects</p><h3>Safety Measures: How to Protect Yourself</h3><p>While we can't control the air quality, we can take steps to minimize its impact on our health. Here's a list of safety measures you can take:</p><p><strong>✓ 1. Wear N95/N99 Masks</strong></p><p>Not all masks are created equal. Regular surgical or cloth masks won't cut it. Invest in N95 or N99 masks that can filter out PM2.5 particles. Wear them whenever you step outside, especially during peak pollution hours (early morning and evening).</p><p><strong>✓ 2. Limit Outdoor Activities</strong></p><p>This is especially crucial for children, elderly people, and those with existing respiratory or heart conditions. Avoid morning walks, outdoor exercise, and playing outside when AQI is above 300. Check the AQI before planning any outdoor activities.</p><p><strong>✓ 3. Use Air Purifiers Indoors</strong></p><p>Invest in a HEPA air purifier for your home, especially for bedrooms. Keep windows and doors closed during high pollution hours. However, remember that purifiers have limitations — they work best in enclosed spaces.</p><p><strong>✓ 4. Stay Hydrated and Eat Right</strong></p><p>Drink plenty of water to help your body flush out toxins. Include antioxidant-rich foods in your diet — green tea, jaggery, turmeric, and fresh fruits like oranges and pomegranates can help combat the effects of pollution.</p><p><strong>✓ 5. Monitor AQI Daily</strong></p><p>Download AQI monitoring apps or check websites like AQI.in, CPCB's Sameer app, or AccuWeather. Plan your day based on pollution levels. If AQI crosses 400, it's a health emergency — stay indoors as much as possible.</p><p><strong>✓ 6. Create a Clean Room</strong></p><p>Designate one room in your house as a "clean room" with an air purifier running continuously. Use this space for sleeping and studying. Seal any cracks in doors and windows.</p><p><strong>✓ 7. Avoid Smoking and Burning Incense</strong></p><p>Indoor air pollution from cigarettes, agarbatti, or burning anything adds to the problem. Keep your indoor air as clean as</p><p><strong>✓ 8. Use Public Transport or Carpool</strong></p><p>Every vehicle on the road adds to pollution. If you must go out, use metro, buses, or carpool. Better yet, work from home if your employer allows it during high pollution days.</p><p><strong>✓ 9. Consult a Doctor if Symptoms Persist</strong></p><p>If you experience persistent coughing, breathing difficulties, chest pain, or irritation in eyes and throat, don't ignore it. Consult a doctor immediately. People with asthma or other respiratory conditions should keep their medications handy.</p><p><strong>✓ 10. Plant Indoor Plants</strong></p><p>While they won't solve the pollution crisis, plants like spider plants, peace lilies, and snake plants can help improve indoor air quality naturally.</p>9:T765,<h2><strong>10th Grade: The Peak of My Academic Delusion</strong></h2><p>10th is funny. Everyone treats it like the “endgame,” but honestly, it’s the calm before the actual storm.</p><p>Here’s what 10th felt like for me:</p><h3><strong>1. Is 10th really hard or it's all just hype?</strong></h3><p>Short answer - <strong>Yes </strong>it's just hype. 10th's tough but not the way they exaggerate it. You will learn some base concepts that will be used in 11th but even if you are weak in them it still don't matter much until you score the percentage you need for your stream.</p><p>I am not saying you can get top grades in your school if you are weak but I am not saying this either that if you don't understand how mitochondria works than you are doomed <em>("I don't know even B of biology lol 😭")</em></p><p>Because suppose you are aiming for JEE than you will need physics chemistry and maths as your strong subjects. Strong enough so you can meet the eligibility for science stream as per your education board.</p><p>Keep in mind that you don't need 90+ percentage to be successful in life. Trust me if you are even a 78+ scorer than you are good. But yea if you dream of going to foreign universities like MIT than you may need a good percentage for manuscript records.</p><p>But again only if you want a foreign university and that too maybe adjusted.</p><p>I scored 85% in my boards and I was worried even after pursuing science stream that I may not be able to cope up but trust me 11th starts from a new basic for toppers and alsaxdl.</p><h3><strong>2. Parental pressure to be topper</strong></h3><p>the classic dialogue of Indian parents</p><blockquote>"10th mei 90% se kam aaye to jeevan barbad hai"</blockquote><p>I am sure you would have heard this dialogue. Trust me. 10th marksheet is just a trophy not a life changer, treat them like normal exams.</p><h3><br></h3>0:{"P":null,"b":"lLieWyCg_MNUqV7ySwol6","c":["",""],"q":"","i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],[["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/chunks/083716d86c88ef0e.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","className":"scroll-smooth","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"inter_c15e96cb-module__0bjUvq__variable lora_f1014322-module__l-izAG__variable jetbrains_mono_2fbad08d-module__Y6qpBa__variable antialiased","children":["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"min-h-screen flex flex-col bg-white dark:bg-dark-bg transition-colors duration-300","children":[["$","$L4",null,{}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-grow w-full max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 py-6 sm:py-12 grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-12 gap-y-12 lg:gap-x-12","children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"lg:col-span-8 min-h-[60vh]","children":["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"className":"py-12 text-center text-stone-400","children":"Loading posts..."}],"children":["$","$L6",null,{"posts":[{"id":"delhi-s-getting-bomb-threats-again","title":"Delhi's Getting Bomb Threats Again","author":"Lairs.bug","date":"Nov 20, 2025","readTime":"4 min","thumbnail":"https://staticimg.amarujala.com/assets/images/2025/11/20/thall-thhamaka_48b6fd984f08469a49db35711811eb66.jpeg?w=674&dpr=1.0&q=80","excerpt":"Multiple schools in Delhi received hoax bomb threats on November 20, 2025 - the latest in a series of false alarms.
