Getting Bomb Threats Again – Here's What's Really Going On\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, Delhi woke up to yet another bomb scare today (November 20, 2025), and honestly, it's getting exhausting. Multiple schools across the capital received threatening emails this morning, causing major panic and disruptions. Let's break down what happened and what we know so far.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat Happened This Morning?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eEarly Thursday morning, at least three prominent private schools in Delhi received bomb threat emails. We're talking about big names here – The British School in Chanakyapuri, Modern School on Barakhamba Road, and Sanskriti School in Chanakyapuri. The threats came in through emails, and obviously, everyone freaked out (rightfully so).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Delhi Police didn't waste time though. Bomb disposal squads, dog squads, and fire department teams rushed to all these schools immediately. Students and staff were evacuated as a precaution while security teams combed through every corner of the buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe good news? Nothing suspicious was found. The police have declared these threats as hoaxes, but the searches were still thorough because, you know, better safe than sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThis Isn't the First Time\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere's the thing – this is becoming way too common. Just two days ago, on November 18, four district courts (Dwarka, Rohini, Saket, and Patiala House) and two CRPF-run schools (in Dwarka and Prashant Vihar) received similar bomb threats. Those were through both emails and phone calls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe threats even mentioned Jaish-e-Mohammed, a terrorist organization, which made things even more serious. But after extensive searches involving bomb squads and security personnel, those also turned out to be hoaxes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy Is This Happening So Much?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe real question everyone's asking is – why are these hoax threats becoming so frequent? Delhi is already on edge after the tragic Red Fort blast on November 10, where 14 people lost their lives. The city's security is on high alert, and these fake threats are not helping anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThese hoax calls and emails are:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.

They're:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- Tracing the sources of these emails and phone calls\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- Investigating whether these threats are coordinated or random\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- Trying to identify the people behind these hoax calls\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- Keeping security heightened across all public institutions\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem is, these callers often use VPNs, fake email addresses, and turn off their phones immediately after making threats, making it harder to track them down quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it's a relief that all these threats have been hoaxes so far, we can't take them lightly. Every threat needs to be investigated properly because we never know when one might be real. But at the same time, whoever is behind these false alarms needs to be caught and held accountable ASAP.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor students, parents, and people working in these institutions – stay alert but don't panic. Follow the instructions from authorities during evacuations, and trust that the security teams are doing their job.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDehli's been through a lot lately, and we don't need people adding to the chaos with fake threats. Let's hope the police track down these culprits soon and put an end to this nonsense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStay safe, everyone. 🙏\u003c/p\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"8:T13e3,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003ch2\u003eThe Reality Check: Delhi's Air Crisis in Numbers\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs of November 20, 2025, Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) has crossed the dreaded 400 mark, officially entering the 'severe' category.

Regular surgical or cloth masks won't cut it. Invest in N95 or N99 masks that can filter out PM2.5 particles. Wear them whenever you step outside, especially during peak pollution hours (early morning and evening).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e✓ 2. Limit Outdoor Activities\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is especially crucial for children, elderly people, and those with existing respiratory or heart conditions.

Stay Hydrated and Eat Right\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDrink plenty of water to help your body flush out toxins.
