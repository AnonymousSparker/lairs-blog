4:Tf34,<h3>Delhi's Getting Bomb Threats Again – Here's What's Really Going On</h3><p>So, Delhi woke up to yet another bomb scare today (November 20, 2025), and honestly, it's getting exhausting. Multiple schools across the capital received threatening emails this morning, causing major panic and disruptions. Let's break down what happened and what we know so far.</p><h3>What Happened This Morning?</h3><p>Early Thursday morning, at least three prominent private schools in Delhi received bomb threat emails. We're talking about big names here – The British School in Chanakyapuri, Modern School on Barakhamba Road, and Sanskriti School in Chanakyapuri. The threats came in through emails, and obviously, everyone freaked out (rightfully so).</p><p>The Delhi Police didn't waste time though. Bomb disposal squads, dog squads, and fire department teams rushed to all these schools immediately. Students and staff were evacuated as a precaution while security teams combed through every corner of the buildings.</p><p>The good news? Nothing suspicious was found. The police have declared these threats as hoaxes, but the searches were still thorough because, you know, better safe than sorry.</p><h3>This Isn't the First Time</h3><p>Here's the thing – this is becoming way too common. Just two days ago, on November 18, four district courts (Dwarka, Rohini, Saket, and Patiala House) and two CRPF-run schools (in Dwarka and Prashant Vihar) received similar bomb threats. Those were through both emails and phone calls.</p><p>The threats even mentioned Jaish-e-Mohammed, a terrorist organization, which made things even more serious. But after extensive searches involving bomb squads and security personnel, those also turned out to be hoaxes.</p><h3>Why Is This Happening So Much?</h3><p>The real question everyone's asking is – why are these hoax threats becoming so frequent? Delhi is already on edge after the tragic Red Fort blast on November 10, where 14 people lost their lives. The city's security is on high alert, and these fake threats are not helping anyone.</p><h3>These hoax calls and emails are:</h3><p><strong>1. Wasting crucial resources –</strong> bomb squads, police personnel, and emergency services are being deployed for false alarms</p><p><strong>2. Causing massive disruptions –</strong> schools getting evacuated, court proceedings getting suspended, parents panicking</p><p>3. Creating <strong>unnecessary fear</strong> in an already tense atmosphere</p><p>4. Making it <strong>harder for authorities</strong> to respond to actual emergencies</p><h3>What Are Authorities Doing?</h3><p>The Delhi Police are taking this seriously (as they should). They're:</p><p>- Tracing the sources of these emails and phone calls</p><p>- Investigating whether these threats are coordinated or random</p><p>- Trying to identify the people behind these hoax calls</p><p>- Keeping security heightened across all public institutions</p><p>The problem is, these callers often use VPNs, fake email addresses, and turn off their phones immediately after making threats, making it harder to track them down quickly.</p><h3>The Bottom Line</h3><p>While it's a relief that all these threats have been hoaxes so far, we can't take them lightly. Every threat needs to be investigated properly because we never know when one might be real. But at the same time, whoever is behind these false alarms needs to be caught and held accountable ASAP.</p><p>For students, parents, and people working in these institutions – stay alert but don't panic. Follow the instructions from authorities during evacuations, and trust that the security teams are doing their job.</p><p>Dehli's been through a lot lately, and we don't need people adding to the chaos with fake threats. Let's hope the police track down these culprits soon and put an end to this nonsense.</p><p>Stay safe, everyone. 🙏</p>0:{"buildId":"lLieWyCg_MNUqV7ySwol6","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"min-h-screen flex flex-col bg-white dark:bg-dark-bg transition-colors duration-300","children":[["$","$L2",null,{}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-grow w-full max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 py-6 sm:py-12 grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-12 gap-y-12 lg:gap-x-12","children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"lg:col-span-8 min-h-[60vh]","children":["$","article",null,{"className":"fade-in bg-white dark:bg-dark-card sm:rounded-2xl sm:border border-stone-100 dark:border-dark-border sm:shadow-sm p-0 sm:p-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"px-4 sm:px-0 pt-4 sm:pt-0","children":["$","$L3",null,{"href":"/","className":"mb-6 text-stone-500 hover:text-stone-900 dark:hover:text-stone-300 transition-colors flex items-center gap-2 text-sm font-mono","children":"← Back to Home"}]}],["$","header",null,{"className":"mb-8 px-4 sm:px-0 pb-8 border-b border-stone-100 dark:border-white/10","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-stone-900 dark:text-white leading-tight mb-6 font-serif","children":"Delhi's Getting Bomb Threats Again"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-3 mb-6","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"w-10 h-10 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden border border-stone-200 dark:border-stone-700","children":["$","img",null,{"src":"/asset/logo.png","alt":"Lairs","className":"w-full h-full object-cover"}]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm font-medium text-stone-900 dark:text-stone-200","children":"Lairs.bug"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-xs text-stone-500 dark:text-stone-400 flex items-center gap-2","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":["4 min"," read"]}],["$","span",null,{"children":"•"}],["$","time",null,{"children":"Nov 20, 2025"}]]}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-8","children":["$","img",null,{"src":"https://staticimg.amarujala.com/assets/images/2025/11/20/thall-thhamaka_48b6fd984f08469a49db35711811eb66.jpeg?w=674&dpr=1.0&q=80","alt":"Delhi's Getting Bomb Threats Again","className":"w-full h-auto max-h-[450px] object-cover rounded-xl shadow-sm"}]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"px-4 sm:px-0 prose prose-stone prose-lg max-w-none mb-12 dark:prose-invert font-serif","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$4"}}],"$L5"]}]}],"$L6"]}]]}],["$L7","$L8"],"$L9"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
