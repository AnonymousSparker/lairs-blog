4:T765,<h2><strong>10th Grade: The Peak of My Academic Delusion</strong></h2><p>10th is funny. Everyone treats it like the “endgame,” but honestly, it’s the calm before the actual storm.</p><p>Here’s what 10th felt like for me:</p><h3><strong>1. Is 10th really hard or it's all just hype?</strong></h3><p>Short answer - <strong>Yes </strong>it's just hype. 10th's tough but not the way they exaggerate it. You will learn some base concepts that will be used in 11th but even if you are weak in them it still don't matter much until you score the percentage you need for your stream.</p><p>I am not saying you can get top grades in your school if you are weak but I am not saying this either that if you don't understand how mitochondria works than you are doomed <em>("I don't know even B of biology lol 😭")</em></p><p>Because suppose you are aiming for JEE than you will need physics chemistry and maths as your strong subjects. Strong enough so you can meet the eligibility for science stream as per your education board.</p><p>Keep in mind that you don't need 90+ percentage to be successful in life. Trust me if you are even a 78+ scorer than you are good. But yea if you dream of going to foreign universities like MIT than you may need a good percentage for manuscript records.</p><p>But again only if you want a foreign university and that too maybe adjusted.</p><p>I scored 85% in my boards and I was worried even after pursuing science stream that I may not be able to cope up but trust me 11th starts from a new basic for toppers and alsaxdl.</p><h3><strong>2. Parental pressure to be topper</strong></h3><p>the classic dialogue of Indian parents</p><blockquote>"10th mei 90% se kam aaye to jeevan barbad hai"</blockquote><p>I am sure you would have heard this dialogue. Trust me. 10th marksheet is just a trophy not a life changer, treat them like normal exams.</p><h3><br></h3>0:{"buildId":"lLieWyCg_MNUqV7ySwol6","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"min-h-screen flex flex-col bg-white dark:bg-dark-bg transition-colors duration-300","children":[["$","$L2",null,{}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-grow w-full max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 py-6 sm:py-12 grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-12 gap-y-12 lg:gap-x-12","children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"lg:col-span-8 min-h-[60vh]","children":["$","article",null,{"className":"fade-in bg-white dark:bg-dark-card sm:rounded-2xl sm:border border-stone-100 dark:border-dark-border sm:shadow-sm p-0 sm:p-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"px-4 sm:px-0 pt-4 sm:pt-0","children":["$","$L3",null,{"href":"/","className":"mb-6 text-stone-500 hover:text-stone-900 dark:hover:text-stone-300 transition-colors flex items-center gap-2 text-sm font-mono","children":"← Back to Home"}]}],["$","header",null,{"className":"mb-8 px-4 sm:px-0 pb-8 border-b border-stone-100 dark:border-white/10","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-stone-900 dark:text-white leading-tight mb-6 font-serif","children":"My 10th Experience"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-3 mb-6","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"w-10 h-10 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden border border-stone-200 dark:border-stone-700","children":["$","img",null,{"src":"/asset/logo.png","alt":"Lairs","className":"w-full h-full object-cover"}]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm font-medium text-stone-900 dark:text-stone-200","children":"Lairs.bug"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-xs text-stone-500 dark:text-stone-400 flex items-center gap-2","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":["2 min"," read"]}],["$","span",null,{"children":"•"}],["$","time",null,{"children":"Nov 19, 2025"}]]}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-8","children":["$","img",null,{"src":"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/3c/95/54/3c9554eb65affa3c8809c1664c24c689.jpg","alt":"My 10th Experience","className":"w-full h-auto max-h-[450px] object-cover rounded-xl shadow-sm"}]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"px-4 sm:px-0 prose prose-stone prose-lg max-w-none mb-12 dark:prose-invert font-serif","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$4"}}],"$L5"]}]}],"$L6"]}]]}],["$L7","$L8"],"$L9"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
